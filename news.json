I'm here to announce the <span class=\"highlight\">final update (v0.4.0)</span> of <span class=\"highlight\">Stardew Valley Food</span>. This project started back in middle school (2022) as my second mod after <em>Smooth Wood</em>, created with MCreator before I learned Gradle or Maven. Over time, it grew to include 60+ food items ported from Stardew Valley — now reaching almost 100k downloads! The 0.4.0 version will be the <strong>final and best version</strong>, released before I head to university. Thank you so much for all the support through the years!</p><p class=\"note\">*(Out of support: Future ports may only include major Minecraft versions like 1.12.2, 1.16.5, 1.17.1, 1.18.2, 1.19.2, 1.20.1, and 1.21.1.)*</p>"
